---

## 🔒 **Security & Best Practices**

- ✅ Gmail App Password used (not regular password)
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Admin-only access to email configuration
- ✅ Non-blocking email sending (won't break order processing)
- ✅ Proper database constraints and indexes
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints

---

## 🎯 **What Works After Deployment**

1. **📧 Automatic Email Notifications**: When order status changes, configured emails are sent
2. **🎛️ Admin Management**: Add/edit/delete email notification rules per shop
3. **🧪 Email Testing**: Test email configuration without affecting real orders
4. **📊 Dashboard Integration**: Admin menu in main navigation
5. **🔄 Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Before You Deploy**

1. **✅ Gmail App Password**: Make sure you have the correct 16-character app password
2. **✅ Railway Variables**: Set all three email variables in Railway dashboard
3. **✅ Database Backup**: Consider backing up production database before migration
4. **✅ Test Plan**: Have a plan to test email functionality after deployment
